                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Oddly enough, but very rarely a tourist goes to a country he has always dreamed of. Most people go to overseas tours, either to those countries that the tour operator will advise, or to where friends already were, or simply to “popular” resorts. And all because we do not know how to choose the right place to rest. Below we will give a few questions, answering which you will be able to determine for yourself a range of countries for yourself, and give the travel agency agent a more accurate match for you. The first, if not banal, is money. Start preparing for the trip is a budget. Decide on the maximum amount you are willing to spend on travel, add to it 20% and you will receive the cost of your trip. Different resorts cost tourists in different amounts, and the level of service does not always play a decisive role. Having determined the amount, “inappropriate” resorts will be eliminated immediately. Of the remaining, you can choose based on the type of holiday. How do you want to spend your vacation? Lazy lying on the beach, extreme fun, or exploring the sights and culture, different places and countries are suitable for each of them and for each of these different types of recreation. Agree, hunting in Monaco is as difficult to imagine as the beaches of Switzerland. Choosing a tour, you should pay attention to such factors as language. English proficiency will help in most countries, but unfortunately not everywhere.</p>

                <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">Personal growth. Anyway, each journey reveals new facets of ourselves. Sometimes, being in our “comfort zone”, without leaving the usual living conditions, we do not even suspect our capabilities. It seems to us that the “work-home” routine circle is all that we are capable of. But this is far from true!
<br>
<br>Living in unexpected, unplanned travel situations, we learn quick response, adaptation, creativity, eccentricity, and we acquire new communication skills. What can I say, a journey is a kind of psychological training. Only all the exercises do not occur in the form of a game, but for real!<br><br>Broadening horizons. Traveling, you just can not learn nothing new. Studying the history, traditions, customs of the country to which you have arrived will enrich you and contribute to easier communication with the local population. Plus, it's just fun! And if you also master a couple of traditional dishes of local cuisine and cook them at home for your loved ones - you will have a lot of warm emotions!<br><br>Spiritual enrichment. Regardless of which religious denomination you belong to and whether you belong at all, familiarity with the spiritual culture of other nations always has a beneficial effect on your soul. Not for nothing, probably, the most diverse pilgrimages to holy places are now so popular. But for peace of mind it is not necessary to go to Vrindavan or Mecca - it is quite possible that you will find him in a completely different place, after talking with an old man from a small village or meditating on a forest clearing. Or maybe you will find it in the middle of a noisy metropolis? Who knows…<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A visa, I think, is obvious, but in fact, many of my friends say they want to book a flight for a visit, and are shocked when I say that they need to apply for a visa. Use sites like iVisa to find out which countries you need a visa for. You can get a visa to most countries through iVisa directly for a small processing fee. I have used this site many times and love it.
<br>
<br>Some territories in India or other countries require entry permits if you have gotten one make a copy of it.
<br>
<br>Copies of passport front photo page and copy of most recent visa. When will you need this? Booking a tourist quota train ticket, getting a SIM card for your phone, staying at hotels that don’t have a copy machine. They will send you out to find a copy before check-in, which is a pain in the butt when it’s 5 am and you want to sleep.
<br>
<br>A 2×2 passport style photograph. You’ll need this to purchase a SIM card, meeting the Dalai Lama, for staying at some ashrams, among other reasons. You usually won’t know ahead of time when they’re going to ask for one, so have it handy. Print about 10 and keep them in a little envelope. I waited in line to see the Dalai Lama not knowing I would need one, but luckily I had that little envelope in my wallet! Crisis averted.
<br>
<br>Driver’s license. Most often you need a local license to legally drive anyways, but at least if you’re pulled over on a scooter you can show them something that might confuse them enough to let you go. Also, I’ve been guided by an Indian that has lived in America for 20 years that you can receive an international license without a test or fee at the DMV in the U.S. I’ll find out if that’s true when I’m back in May.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style align-left display-7">If you do not want to burden yourself with things, then one smartphone will suffice for a short trip. Just take care that he is a universal assistant. Install on it: 1) a program with maps that work without the Internet, 2) an offline translator, 3) a reader, 4) a handy notepad, 5) SkyScanner application to search for air tickets, accommodation and car rental right on the road. Read more about what useful travel apps can come in handy.
<br>
<br>If you understand that you will not manage with one smartphone, look, what else from the technology will be useful in traveling:
<br>
<br>Appliances and gadgets on the road
<br>Exactly needed:
<br>Smartphone and Charging On the road, it is convenient to use a long-lived smartphone with a battery capacity of 4,000 mAh. If your smartphone quickly sits down, take a compact external battery, for example, the Hiper XP10500. Charging from the smartphone take in your carry-on luggage.
<br>
<br>May be useful:
<br>External hard disk If you don’t plan to take tons of heavy images, you can temporarily record the excess information on your smartphone, then you will not need a hard disk.
<br>Travel iron In many hotels give irons or iron things for a fee. If it’s important to keep your iron handy, get a compact one like the Philips GC651. Iron is not needed if you fold things in a suitcase in thick rolls, and in the hotel immediately hang on hangers or the back of a chair. It is even more convenient to take non-laundering things on the trip.
<br>Small electric kettle Some hotels have kettles in the rooms, and there is also a cooler at the reception. If you want to go with your own, take it light and compact - for example, the TEFAL KO 1021 weighs half a kilo. And you can also replace it with a good old kettle.
<br>Headphones For travel, choose headphones with good noise insulation.
<br>Laptop and charging Take charge from laptop and smartphone in your carry-on baggage. Then you recharge the devices at the airport and during the flight, and you will not be left without equipment if the luggage is delayed or lost.
<br>Plug Socket Find out which sockets are in the right country and get the right one. In a trip to several countries it is convenient to take a universal adapter.
<br>Player To save weight, leave the player at home and download music to your smartphone.
<br>Tee, extension or network filter Many-placed outlets will be needed if you take a lot of gadgets.
<br>Hairdryer There are hair dryers in many hotels: check before you go. If not, or you want your own, then look at the road models.
<br>Camera, charging, memory cards, camera bag In addition to the main photographic equipment, photographers can use interchangeable lenses and filters.
<br>Tripod, monopod, selfie stick Some airlines do not allow you to take a tripod and a selfie stick in your hand luggage.
<br>E-book In order not to take unnecessary things, install a reader on your smartphone and download books.</p>
